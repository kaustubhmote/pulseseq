bruker.vim is a vim syntax file for bruker
This is not complete and definitely needs work

Add bruker.vim to your vim syntax directory 

bruker-colors.vim is a color scheme that I like on a dark background in vim for looking at the pulse sequence
Its basically the 'neverland' color scheme with some modifications. This needs to go in your vim colors directory

Add the following lines to your .vimrc

"bruker file type
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.pseq setlocal ft=bruker
au BufNewFile,BufRead pulseprogram setlocal ft=bruker
autocmd FileType bruker colorscheme neverland
