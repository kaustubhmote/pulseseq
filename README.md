# PULSESEQ
NMR pulse sequences (`pp_solids` and `pp_solution`), decoupling sequences (`cpd`), shape pulses (`wave`), AU (`au`) and Python (`python`) programs for Bruker spectrometers.

## Requirements
All of the pulse-sequences given here have been implemented on spectrometers with Avance III console and TopSpin version >= 2.1
Each pulse-sequence will have the TopSpin software version where it was tested

## Installation
You can download this repository with `git clone https://github.com/kaustubhmote/pulseseq.git`. Unpack the contents in their respective places in the topspin directory:
- `pp_solids` and `pp_solution` : TOPSPIN_FOLDER/exp/stan/nmr/lists/pp/user
- `wave` : TOPSPIN_FOLDER/exp/stan/nmr/lists/wave/user
- `au` : TOPSPIN_FOLDER/exp/stan/nmr/au/src/user
- `cpd`: TOPSPIN_FOLDER/exp/stan/nmr/lists/cpd/user
- `python` : TOPSPIN_FOLDER/exp/stan/nmr/py/user
