## PULSESEQ
NMR pulse sequences for Bruker spectrometers

# Requirements
All of the pulse-sequences given here have been implemented on spectrometers with Avance III console and TopSpin version >= 2.1
Each pulse-sequence will have the TopSpin software version where it was tested

# Installation
You can download this repository with `git clone https://github.com/kaustubhmote/pulseseq.git`	

# Copy files to pulse-program directory
The directory structure here is similar to the directory structure in your topspin directory
You can directly copy the files into `pp/user`.
