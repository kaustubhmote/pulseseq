# Pulse sequences 

All pulse sequences described here have been implemented for internal use at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. 

# Default parameters

To ensure that all default pulses, durations, etc are uniform in all pulse sequences, the following nomenclatures are observed

- 90 deg pulse on 1H: `p1`
- 90 deg pulse on 13C: `p2` 
- 90 deg pulse on 15N: `p3`
- Pulses reserved for CP blocks: `p15, p17, p25, p27`
- Pulses reserved for decoupling blocks: `p31, p32`
